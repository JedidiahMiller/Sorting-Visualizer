# Sorting-Visualizer

Thing that allows you to see sorting algorithms in action

## Abstract

The goal of this project is to have a simple way of viewing what happens within an array when a sorting algorithm is running.

## Running the code

index.html acts as the launching point for running everything. Due to cross-origin CORS stuff making directly opening the file in a browser difficult, the easiest way to run the code is by navigating to the projects directory in a terminal and then running 'python3 -m http.server'. The terminal should prompt you to open a link in a browser, which will by default be localhost:8000
