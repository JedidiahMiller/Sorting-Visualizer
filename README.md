# Sorting-Visualizer

This project aims to give the user a visualization of how various sorting algorithms can work within the constraints of a single array.

## Running the code

This project is currently being hosted at https://jedidiahmiller.github.io/Sorting-Visualizer. 

## Some notes on code design
This project was put together using ES6 modules. The Typescript compiler does not default to this, so the modules setting within the tsconfig file should be adjusted accordingly.
This project uses the standard index.html starting access point.
JS files that are ready to be run can be found in the TSInterpretation/build directory
